## 🛠️ Development Process

### 1. 📋 User Stories Definition
We started by analyzing and documenting **94 detailed user stories** covering all roles in the system. These were used as the foundation for design and implementation.

### 2. 🏗️ Architecture Design
We created a scalable and modular system architecture using **React.js**, following component-based design to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

### 3. 💻 Implementation
Our development process focused on:
- Building reusable React components.
- Simulating backend operations for authentication and notifications.
- Ensuring a responsive and accessible UI using HTML and CSS.
- Implementing logical workflows for application status changes and reports.

### 4. ✅ Testing Phase
- Manual testing for all user stories and flows.
- Ensured that navigation, filtering, forms, and uploads worked as intended.
- Focused on edge cases in application status transitions and reporting features.
